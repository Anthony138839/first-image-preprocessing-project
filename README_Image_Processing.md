# 🖼️ Image Preprocessing Exercise

This is a beginner-level exercise focused on basic **image preprocessing** using Python libraries like **Matplotlib**, **PIL (Pillow)**, and **OpenCV**.

## 📌 What the Code Does

- 📥 Loads an image from a local path  
- 📊 Displays the original image using `matplotlib`  
- 📏 Checks the image dimensions  
- 🔄 Resizes the image to 200x200 pixels using `Pillow`  
- 💾 Saves the resized image as `dice.jpg`  

## 🛠️ Tools and Libraries Used

- `matplotlib` – for displaying images  
- `Pillow (PIL)` – for image resizing and saving  
- `cv2 (OpenCV)` – imported but not used in this exercise  

## 📁 File Info

- **Notebook name**: `image_processing_exercise1.ipynb`  
- **Image saved as**: `dice.jpg`  

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Make sure your Python environment has the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install matplotlib pillow opencv-python
   ```
2. Open the notebook and run the cells in order.

## 📸 Sample Output

You’ll see the original image plotted, and the resized version saved in the working directory.
